# Own-words

This project's idea is aimed at helping language learners improve their vocabulary using subjects and text they like and are interested in. The process involves extracting keywords from input text and providing translations in target language. It also provides 2 related words to each word from text with their translation to help further expand learner's vocabulary list. 

Steps are included with notes in the jupyter notebook as well as link below to heroku app, only German is included at the moment and due to memory and processing limitaions it can process very short text only, 30 words or less, but the code itself can work with any text length.
